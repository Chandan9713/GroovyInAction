# Prerequisites

* Java 1.7 or higher
* Groovy 2.4.1 or higher

# Considerations

One can run all listings by calling

    groovy alltests

However, since some listings rely on external
constraints like special versions of the JVM
(e.g. to test Groovy features for Java 8) or
OS-specific integration features, some listings
may be excluded from execution.

Listings are usually made such that you can 
`cd` into the directory for that chapter and
call the listing via

	groovy mylistingname
	
If no other instructions apply, you best 
use Groovy 2.4.1 and Java 7. More recent versions
will also work in most cases.

Keep groovin'
